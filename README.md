I have created code for the Wordle game, and a bot that solves the Wordle game entirely in Python.

The file "Wordle Bot.py" contains a smaller list of words, and will always solve my own Wordle game, and other wordle games on most occasions.

However the file "Wordle Bot - Solve any Wordle Game.py" contains a much larger word list, meaning it can solve almost any Wordle game out there every single time.
